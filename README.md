# Tic-Tac-Toe-Computer
A tic-tac-toe game with a computer that never loses.
The TicTacComputer folder contains all the code and resources used for the Tic-Tac-Toe Computer application. The code is specifically found in the TicTacComputer>src folder. Program was written using NetBeans.
The TicTac jar file just runs the application as it would be intended for a user.
Note: The option for the computer to not go first is still bugged and is being looked at.
